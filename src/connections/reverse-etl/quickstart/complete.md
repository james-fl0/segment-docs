Congratulations! You've successfully set up Reverse ETL. Your data will extract and sync to your destination(s) right away if you chose an interval schedule when creating your mapping. If you set your data to extract at a specific day and time, the extraction will take place then.

To edit your mapping or model, see the [Edit your Reverse ETL connections].
