title: Create a Model
strat: retl-quickstart

Now that you've added your warehouse as a RETL source, you can create a model, or a SQL query that define sets of data you want to synchronize to your Reverse ETL destinations. 

To add your first model:
1. Navigate to **Connections > Sources** and select the **Reverse ETL** tab. Select your source and click **Add Model**.
2. Click **SQL Editor** as your modeling method. (Segment will add more modeling methods in the future.)
3. Enter the SQL query thatâ€™ll define your model. Your model is used to map data to your Reverse ETL destinations.
4. Choose a column to use as the unique identifier for each record in the **Unique Identifier column** field.
    * The Unique Identifier should be a column with unique values per record to ensure checkpointing works as expected. It can potentially be a primary key. This column is used to detect new, updated, and deleted records.
5. Click **Preview** to see a preview of the results of your SQL query. The data from the preview is extracted from the first 10 records of your warehouse.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Enter your **Model Name**.
8. Click **Create Model**.
