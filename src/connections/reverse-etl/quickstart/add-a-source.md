In Reverse ETL, your data warehouse is the "source" of your data.

To add your data warehouse as a source:
1. **Open the [Reverse ETL catalog](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog?category=Reverse%20ETL){:target="_blank”}.** navigate to **Connections > Sources** and select the **Reverse ETL** tab in the Segment app.
2. Select the source you want to add.
3. Follow the corresponding setup guide for your Reverse ETL source.
